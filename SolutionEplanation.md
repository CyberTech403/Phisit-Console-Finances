## Title

```
const titleName = "Financial Analysis";
const spaceLine = "-".repeat(16);

console.log(titleName);
console.log(spaceLine);
```

titleName.length: This retrieves the length of the string stored in the variable titleName. The length property of a string returns the number of characters in the string.

"-".repeat(...): The repeat method is a built-in method in JavaScript that creates a new string by repeating an existing string a specified number of times. In this case, the string being repeated is "-", and the number of repetitions is equal to the length of the string stored in titleName.

const spaceLine = ...;: This declares a constant variable named spaceLine and assigns it the value generated by "-".repeat(titleName.length).

Putting it all together, the purpose of this code is to create a string (spaceLine) consisting of hyphens ("-") repeated a number of times equal to the length of the titleName string. This is often used to create a separator line with a length matching the length of the title when printed to the console. For example, if titleName is "Financial Analysis" with a length of 17 characters, then spaceLine will be "-----------------".

## Task 1 Solution

```
var allMonths = finances.map(entry => entry[0].split('-')[0]);
var totalMonths = allMonths.length;
console.log("Total number of months: " + totalMonths);
```

I employed the concatenation method to join strings and variables in my code. Nevertheless, I find it more preferable to utilize the "Template literals" approach.

For example:

` Total amount of Profit/Losses: ${netTotal} `

This preference arises because it eliminates the need for the "+" operator and parentheses. Thus,enhancing code readability and significantly speeding up the typing process.
